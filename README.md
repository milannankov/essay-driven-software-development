# Essay-Driven Software Development
Companion Github repo to my article [Essay-Driven Software Development](https://nankov.com/essay-driven-software-development).

Here you will find the template that I use when I start writing an essay as well as some sample essays that I have written which can be used as a reference.

The sample essays are real essays that I have written for one of my side projects. Even though the information is somewhat domain-specific I have picked topics that can be easily digested.

1. [essay-template.md](./essay-template.md) - Blank template to get you started.
2. [sample-essay.md](./sample-essay.md) - Essay exploring if an optimization should be implemented.
